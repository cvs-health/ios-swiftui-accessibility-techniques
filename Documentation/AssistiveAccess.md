# Assistive Access
Assistive Access simplifies the iOS experience for users with cognitive disabilities. 

Use `UISupportsFullScreenInAssistiveAccess` for the app to appear as full screen in Assistive Access. 

Add the "Supports full screen in Assistive Access" Boolean property with the value `YES` to your `Info.plist` which is: `<key>UISupportsFullScreenInAssistiveAccess</key>` `<true/>` if editing the `Info.plist` source code. 

Do not used fixed screen sizes in the app.
