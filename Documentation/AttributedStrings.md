# Attributed Strings

Attributed Strings can have different attributes and styles for different parts of text in the string. 

When using attributed strings to visually convey meaning to sighted users there must also be meaningful alt text in the `.accessibilityLabel` of the attributed string. 

`.accessibilitySpeechAdjustedPitch` can be used to speak attributed strings to VoiceOver in a higher or lower pitch.
