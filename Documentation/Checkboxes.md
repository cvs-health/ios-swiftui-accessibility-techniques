# Checkboxes
Code checkboxes as `Toggle` elements with a custom `.toggleStyle`. 

Use `Toggle("Label Text")` to create label text. 

Use `.accessibilityValue(isChecked ? "Checked" : "Unchecked")` to create custom value text for VoiceOver. 

Checkbox groups need an accessibility label for the group which matches the visible group label text. 

Use `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)` and `.accessibilityLabel("Group Label")` on the checkbox group container so that VoiceOver users hear the group label spoken when first moving focus to a checkbox in the group.

Notes:
- SwiftUI has no native checkbox control or accessibility trait for VoiceOver. 
- In XCUITesting use `.switches` to select a `Toggle` as `.toggles` does not work.
