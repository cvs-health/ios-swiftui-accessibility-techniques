# Data Tables
Data table cells need to have their row and column header text spoken to VoiceOver users. Set the `.accessibilityHint`, `.accessibilityValue`, or `.accessibilityLabel` for each cell to include its row and column header text. 

The data table should also have a heading set as the `.accessibilityLabel` for the group. 

Use `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)` and `.accessibilityLabel("Table Name")` to give the table a group label that is spoken to VoiceOver users when they first focus on a cell in the table.

Notes:

- iOS has no native data table semantics like `<table>`, `<th>`, `<td>`, or `<caption>` elements in HTML, however, there is a native `Table()` element designed only for iPad and macOS which has an accessibility platform defect listed below.

Platform Defects:

- Native `Table()` elements are designed to work only on iPad or macOS and have a platform defect where their row headers are not spoken to VoiceOver when moving between rows.
