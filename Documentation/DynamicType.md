# Dynamic Type
Use Dynamic Type text styles so that text automatically scales to larger sizes when the user adjusts their iOS text size settings. iOS users must be able to increase the text size of the application without loss of content.

Use a `.font()` style like `.largeTitle`, `.caption`, `.headline`, `.subheadline`, etc. Or use text with no size defined and it will dynamically scale. 

Avoid using `.lineLimit()` which will cause text truncation.

Avoid using fixed sized text which does not scale.

Avoid using `HStack` with multiple links at large text sizes. 

Notes:

- Use `axis: .vertical` to enable `TextField` value text to expand vertically rather than truncate.
