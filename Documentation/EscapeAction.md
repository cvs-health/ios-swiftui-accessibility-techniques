# Escape Action
The escape action is built into native dialogs and navigation views and allows VoiceOver users to perform a 2-finger scrub gesture by drawing the letter Z with 2 fingers which then closes the dialog or activates the back button in a navigation view. 

Use `.accessibilityAction(.escape)` to close a custom dialog or view and return focus when the VoiceOver escape gesture (2 finger Z) is activated.
