# Functional Images
Functional images are used as operable controls like buttons or links and need an `.accessibilityLabel` that describes their function to VoiceOver users.

The `.accessibilityLabel` of a functional image should not describe what an image looks like, intead, it should describe its function. 

Notes:

* Functional images should not include the word "Image" or "Icon" in the `.accessibilityLabel` as that does not describe the function of the control.
