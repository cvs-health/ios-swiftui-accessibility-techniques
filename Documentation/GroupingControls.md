# Grouping Controls

VoiceOver users need to hear the group label text spoken when they first focus on a control in a group of related controls. 

Use `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)` and `.accessibilityLabel("Group Label")` on the group container.

Warning:

- Using `.accessibilityLabel` on the group container without also using `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)` will incorrectly override the visible label text of the controls inside the group and lead to a Label in Name failure.
