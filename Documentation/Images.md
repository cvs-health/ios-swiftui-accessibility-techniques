# Images
Use an `.accessibilityLabel` to provide text alternatives for images to VoiceOver users. 

Informative and Functional images need accessibility labels. Decorative images need to be hidden from VoiceOver focus.

- [Functional](FunctionalImages.md)

Notes:

* Images created from a file will speak their filename to VoiceOver users if an `.accessibilityLabel` is not applied or the image is not hidden from VoiceOver using `.accessibilityHidden(true)`.
