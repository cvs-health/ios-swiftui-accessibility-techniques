# Increase Contrast
Make sure that text and non-text content has sufficient contrast in the default presentation of your app. 

You can also enhance the contrast of the UI if the user enables Increase Contrast in their Accessibility Settings. 

- Use `@Environment(\\.colorSchemeContrast)` to check if the user has enabled Increase Contrast and then increase the contrast of your UI.
