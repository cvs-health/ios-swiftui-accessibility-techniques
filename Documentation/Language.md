# Language
Parts of the app or page that are in a different language than the main language must be spoken to VoiceOver users in the correct speech synthesizer, i.e., Spanish text must be spoken in a Spanish synthesizer with the correct accent and pronunciations.

Use an `AttributedString` with `attributes: AttributeContainer().languageIdentifier()` on the different language text so VoiceOver speaks it correctly with a proper accent for that language.
