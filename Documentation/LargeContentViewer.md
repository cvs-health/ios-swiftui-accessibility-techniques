# Large Content Viewer
Large Content Viewer allows a large text size user to view a large version of content that does not resize with dynamic type. 

Enable Larger Accessibility Sizes under Large Text settings and then hold one finger on top an element that does not resize with dynamic type and a large version of the element will display in the middle of the screen. 

Use `.accessibilityShowsLargeContentViewer{}` to display a button's `Label` and `systemImage` in the large content viewer.
