# Meaningful Accessible Names

Accessible names of UI controls must be meaningful when spoken to VoiceOver users. 

Use unique and specific label text to create meaningful accessible names for VoiceOver users. 

Use a unique and specific `.accessibilityLabel` if the visible label text does not meaningfully describe its specific function. 

Notes:
- If modifying the accessible name of a control, make sure to add the visible label text at the beginning of the `.accessibilityLabel`.
