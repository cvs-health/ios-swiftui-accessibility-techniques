# Pickers
Pickers need visible label text and an accessibility label. Pickers with the default or `MenuPickerStyle` need `Picker("Label")` text which is spoken to VoiceOver as the accessibility label. 

Pickers with the `WheelPickerStyle` or `SegmentedPickerStyle` need an `.accessibilityLabel` set to match their visible label text and need `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)` or else the accessibility label will not be spoken to VoiceOver. 

Don't use `.accessibilityLabel` on `Picker` with the default or `MenuPickerStyle` or else VoiceOver will not speak the visible picker value text when the picker is closed. 

Use `AccessibilityFocusState` to send VoiceOver focus back to the picker when the value has been changed.
- `Picker` has no `onDismiss` method like a `Sheet` that could be used to return focus when the picker is closed.
