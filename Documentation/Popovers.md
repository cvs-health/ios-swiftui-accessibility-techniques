# Popovers

VoiceOver focus must move to the popover when displayed and back to the trigger button when the popover is closed. 

Popover title text must be coded as a Heading for VoiceOver users. 

Use `.popover()` to code a native SwiftUI popover that receives VoiceOver focus when opened. 

Use `AccessibilityFocusState` to send focus back to the trigger button that opened the popover when the popover is closed.

Place the popover's content inside a `ScrollView` or else the text will truncate when enlarged.      

Bugs:

- Popovers will not automatically send focus back to the trigger button and this could be considered an accessibility defect in Apple's native `.popover()` component in which case bugs should be filed with Apple.
