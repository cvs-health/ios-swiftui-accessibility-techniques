# Progress Indicators
Progress indicators are used to show page loading status or the progress of a task. 
- VoiceOver users must hear an accessibility label that matches the visible progress indicator label text. 
- The correct progress indicator value must be spoken to VoiceOver. 
- When a progress spinner is displayed its label text must be spoken to VoiceOver.

Create progress indicators with visible `ProgressView("Label")` label text which then becomes the accessibility label for VoiceOver. 
 
Notes:

- Post an `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement` speaking the loading indicator text to VoiceOver when displaying page loading indicators.
