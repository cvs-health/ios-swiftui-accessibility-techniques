# iOS SwiftUI Accessibility Techniques
iOS SwiftUI sample code demonstrating a variety of good and bad accessibility coding techniques.

Demonstrates accessibility techniques for iOS SwiftUI apps using a collection of good and bad examples that can be tested with VoiceOver and other iOS assistive technologies.

Using the app with VoiceOver will demonstrate the right and wrong ways of applying accessibility to a SwiftUI app. 

Review the project source code to see how to apply the accessibility techniques in working SwiftUI code examples.

Documentation files for each technique are listed below.
