# Accessibility Input Labels

Accessibility Input Labels can provide multiple alternative voice input labels for Voice Control users to speak when tapping a control via voice commands. 

Use `.accessibilityInputLabels` to provide multiple voice input labels in descending order of importance. 


Use the Voice Control "Show Names" and "Tap" commands to test this technique.

Notes:

- The first input label provided will be displayed to Voice Control users with the "Show Names" command.
