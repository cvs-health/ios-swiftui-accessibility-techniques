# Accessibility Responds To User Interaction
`.accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction(true|false)` can control if elements are focusable and operable with accessibility features such as Switch Control, Voice Control, and Full Keyboard Access. 

Don't use this property unless you need to make an element focusable that is not by default or if you need to remove an element from the focus order.
