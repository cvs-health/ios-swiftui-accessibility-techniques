# Accordions
Accordion controls expand and collapse to show and hide content. VoiceOver users must hear the "Expanded" and "Collapsed" state of accordions.

Use `DisclosureGroup` to create an accessible accordion with expanded and collapsed states for VoiceOver. 

Use `DisclosureGroupStyle` to create a custom accordion style using the native `DisclosureGroup`. 

Known Issues:

* Don't use an `.accessibilityLabel` on a `DisclosureGroup` because it will override all text inside the expanded accordion and only the `.accessibilityLabel` will be spoken to VoiceOver. Instead use `.accessibilityHint` if you want to add unique text to repeating `DisclosureGroup` accordions.

Platform Defects:
* VoiceOver reading order is incorrect for expanded DisclosureGroup accordion controls, Apple Feedback Assistant #: FB15338666.
