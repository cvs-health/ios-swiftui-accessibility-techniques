# Accordions
Accordion controls expand and collapse to show and hide content. VoiceOver users must hear the "Expanded" and "Collapsed" state of accordions.

Use `DisclosureGroup` to create an accessible accordion with expanded and collapsed states for VoiceOver. 

Notes:

* Use `DisclosureGroupStyle` to create a custom accordion style using the native `DisclosureGroup` that retains the expanded and collapsed states.
