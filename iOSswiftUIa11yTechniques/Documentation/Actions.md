# Actions
Use `accessibilityAction()` to provide actions on a view that can be activated by iOS Assistive Technologies like VoiceOver.

Full Keyboard Access users can press `Tab + z` to open Actions menu.

Voice Control users can say "Show actions for" and the name or number of the element to open its Actions menu.

Include a name for the action when using multiple accessibility actions, e.g., `.accessibilityAction(named: "Delete")` and `.accessibilityAction(named: "Mark Unread")`.
