# Adjustable Action

Use `.accessibilityAdjustableAction` to allow VoiceOver users to adjust an incrementable control like a custom star rating widget. 

With `.accessibilityAdjustableAction` VoiceOver users can swipe up or down to increment and decrement the adjustable control's value.

Notes:

- `.accessibilityElement()`, `.accessibilityLabel`, and `.accessibilityValue` are also needed to make a custom control accessible.
