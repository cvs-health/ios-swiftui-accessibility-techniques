# Buttons
Buttons need unique and specific label text or `.accessibilityLabel` that describes their function to VoiceOver users. 

Button states must be conveyed to VoiceOver users. Use `.disabled(true)` to set a disabled button.

Notes:

* When there are multiple buttons on a page with the same label modify each button's `.accessibilityLabel` so they are unique and specific when spoken to VoiceOver. 
* If overriding a button's `.accessibilityLabel` make sure to include the visible button text at the beginning of the `.accessibilityLabel`, e.g., `.accessibilityLabel = "Edit Username"` for a button labeled "Edit".
* Don't include the word "Button" in an `.accessibilityLabel` or else VoiceOver will speak "Button, Button".
