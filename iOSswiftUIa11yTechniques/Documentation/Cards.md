# Cards

Cards need a heading as the first focused element with VoiceOver. 

Card call to action button or link needs to be unique and specific when spoken to VoiceOver users and may require an `.accessibilityLabel`. 

Cards with many actions can be combined as one focusable element by wrapping the card in a `NavigationLink` or using `.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` and any actions missing when combined can be included using `.accessibilityAction`.
