# Combining Focus

Use `.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to combine child views into a parent view focused by VoiceOver as a single element. 

When combining child elements their accessibility properties may not all transfer into the combined view as expected. 

If a child `Button` is combined into a parent element the button's accessibility label will not transfer unless the `.isButton` trait is removed. 

If important traits are removed in the child elements make sure to add them back to the combined accessibility element.
