# Dark Mode
Dark Mode improves readability for users with visual impairments and for users when reading at night or in low light conditions.

Make sure that text and non-text content has sufficient contrast in both light and dark mode. 

Use `@Environment(\.colorScheme)` to check if the user is in dark or light mode and then adjust the colors to meet contrast requirements for both modes.

Notes:
- Choose an `AccentColor` with sufficient contrast for light and dark appearance in the assets catalog `Assets.xcassets` file.
