# Date & Time Pickers
Date Pickers are used to select dates and times. VoiceOver users need to hear the visible label text spoken when focused on the date picker. 

Date Pickers without the `.graphical` or `.wheel` style need an `.accessibilityLabel` set to match their visible label text. 

Date Pickers with the `.graphical` or `.wheel` style need visible `DatePicker("Label")` text for each date picker so it is spoken to VoiceOver as the accessibility label.

Limitations:

- The visible `DatePicker` label text will not automatically become the accessibility label for VoiceOver and will need a `.accessibilityLabel` manually applied.
- `DatePicker` with `.graphical` or `.wheel` style does not need the extra `.accessibilityLabel` manually applied or else both the visible label and the accessibility will be spoken.
- `AccessibilityFocusState` does not work with `DatePicker` to return focus.
  
 Platform Defects:
- Wheel style Pickers do not have sufficient text contrast for their non-selected options.
- Date Pickers do not have sufficient contrast for their (S, M, T, W, T, F, S) column header text.
- Date & Time Pickers will not automatically send focus back to the trigger button and this could be considered an accessibility defect in Apple's native `DatePicker` component in which case bugs should be filed with Apple.
- Date, Time, and Wheel Pickers do not support Dynamic Type text resize or the Large Content Viewer.
