# Dim Flashing Lights

Do not use flashing content as it can cause migraines, dizziness, nausea, and seizures. 

If flashing content is used then support the Dim Flashing Lights accessibility setting and stop the flashing. 

Use the `@Environment(\.accessibilityDimFlashingLights)` variable to stop flashing content when Dim Flashing Lights is enabled.
