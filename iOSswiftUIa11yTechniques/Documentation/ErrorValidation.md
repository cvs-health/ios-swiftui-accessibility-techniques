# Error Validation

Error validation is used to convey error messages for missing or incorrectly entered data. VoiceOver users must hear an error message spoken when submitting a form with invalid data and when focused on invalid inputs.

* Use [`AccessibilityFocusState`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/accessibilityfocusstate) to move VoiceOver focus to the first invalid input or error text when submitting a form with invalid data. 
* Use an `.accessibilityHint` matching the visible error message text for each invalid input.
* Visually indicate required fields e.g. with an \* and explain the meaning of the \*.

Notes:

* Make sure error messages are meaningful and specific. 
* Don't rely on color as the only method of indicating errors.
