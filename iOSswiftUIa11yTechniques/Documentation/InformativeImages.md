# Informative Images
Informative images convey meaning visually and require an `.accessibilityLabel` to provide a text alternative to VoiceOver users.

The `.accessibilityLabel` of an informative image must match all relevant content and text shown in the image. 

Notes:

* Don't include the word "Image" in the `.accessibilityLabel` value because the "Image" trait is already spoken to VoiceOver when focused on an image element, otherwise VoiceOver would speak "Image, Image".
- Use `.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to combine an image and text into a single focusable element with VoiceOver.
