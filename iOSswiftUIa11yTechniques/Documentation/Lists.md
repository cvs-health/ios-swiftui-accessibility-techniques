# Lists
Lists need to have list items that are individually focusable with VoiceOver. Use a separate `Text()` element for each list item.

The entire list must not be focused as one single paragraph. Don't use list items that are visually separated using the `\n` new line character.

Notes:

- iOS has no native list semantics like `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` elements in HTML.
- List items can be coded inside a native SwiftUI `List{}` but VoiceOver will not speak a "List" trait or "1 of 6" number of items list semantics.
