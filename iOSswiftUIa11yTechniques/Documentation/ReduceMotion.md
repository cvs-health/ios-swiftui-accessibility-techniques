# Reduce Motion

Motion and Animations must have a method to be paused, stopped, or hidden so that users are not distracted by the moving content. 

Provide a pause button when animations or moving content are used or support the user's Reduce Motion accessibility preferences and stop moving content when enabled. 

Use the `@Environment(\\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` variable to stop moving content when Reduce Motion is enabled.
