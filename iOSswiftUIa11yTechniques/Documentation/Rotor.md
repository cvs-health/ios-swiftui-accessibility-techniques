# Rotor
Accessibility Rotor is used to quickly navigate to specific elements or ranges of text on the page. 

With VoiceOver on rotate 2 fingers on the screen to select the rotor option and then swipe up or down with 1 finger to move between those elements. 

Use `.accessibilityRotor()` with the rotor name and element entries it will navigate to create a custom rotor for VoiceOver users.
