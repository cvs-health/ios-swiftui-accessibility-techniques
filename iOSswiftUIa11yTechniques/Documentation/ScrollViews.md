# Scroll Views

Bugs:

- Scroll views are not scrollable with Full Keyboard Access unless there is a focusable control like a `Button` or `DisclosureGroup` inside or after the scroll view. The `ScrollView` can also be made `.focusable()` or a focusable element can be placed inside the scroll view to allow Full Keyboard Access.
