# Sliders
Sliders are used to adjust a value by sliding the thumb between the minimum and maximum. VoiceOver users must hear the slider accessibility label and "adjustable" trait as well as be able to adjust the value by swiping up or down.

Use `Slider` to create a native slider control that is adjustable with VoiceOver. 

Give each `Slider` a unique and specific accessibility label using `.accessibilityLabel` and visible label `Text`. 

Notes:

- Include a `TextField` and `Stepper` to allow users fine control when adjusting the slider value.
