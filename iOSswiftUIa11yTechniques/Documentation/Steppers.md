# Steppers
Steppers are used to increase or decrease incremental values. VoiceOver users need to hear the visible label text spoken as the accessibility label when they focus on the stepper. 

Use internal `Stepper` `Text(\"Label\")` to create a visible label that becomes the accessibility label for VoiceOver users.

Notes:

- Manually applying a `.accessibilityLabel` is not necessary for a `Stepper` because the internal label text becomes the accessibility label for VoiceOver.

Platform Defects:
- Steppers do not support Large Content Viewer.
