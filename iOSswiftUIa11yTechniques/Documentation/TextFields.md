# Text Fields
Text fields require visible label text next to the field which must be set as the `.accessibilityLabel` of the `TextField`.

Or provide visible labels using `LabeledContent` and then an `.accessibilityLabel` is not required. Don't use `.labeledContentStyle(.vertical)` or else VoiceOver won't be able to double tap to activate the `TextField`.

VoiceOver users must hear the label text spoken when focused on the text field.

Don't use placeholder text which has insufficient contrast and disappears after the user enters a value. 

Notes:

* Use `.textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)` to make the `TextField` visually identifiable. 
* Use `.border(.secondary)` to give the border a 3:1 contrast ratio in light and dark mode. 
* Use `.keyboardType` to specify the keyboard displayed on input. 
* Use `.textContentType` to enable form AutoFill for each `TextField`.

VoiceOver Bugs:
- VoiceOver operation is blocked when using `LabeledContent` with a `TextField` and `.labeledContentStyle(.vertical)` because VoiceOver users cannot double tap to activate the TextField and enter a value. Bug reports should be filed with Apple.
