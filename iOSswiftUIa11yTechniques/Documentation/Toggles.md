# Toggles
Toggles are used to switch between two options (also called switch controls). VoiceOver users must hear the "On" and "Off" state of toggles.

Use `Toggle` to create native toggle controls with an "On" and "Off" state. 

Use `Toggle("Label Text")` to give the toggle a visible label and accessibility label. 

A custom `.toggleStyle` can be used to customize the appearance and color of the toggle, e.g., to set the off state color to `Color.gray` which has 3:1 contrast ratio in the off state.

Notes:
- If there is no unique `Toggle("Label Text")` then the toggle must have a unique and specific `.accessibilityLabel`. 
- Set the correct `.accessibilityValue` if the toggle has visible value text other than On and Off.
- In XCUITesting use `.switches` to select a `Toggle` as `.toggles` does not work.
