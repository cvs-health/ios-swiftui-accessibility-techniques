# VoiceOver Pronunciation

VoiceOver Pronunciation can be controlled by using `.speechAlwaysIncludesPunctuation()` or `.speechSpellsOutCharacters()`. 

Use `.speechAlwaysIncludesPunctuation()` to make VoiceOver speak all punctuation characters, e.g., for code snippets or grammar usage guidance. 

Use `.speechSpellsOutCharacters()` if VoiceOver incorrectly speaks text together as one word when it should speak the text letter by letter.

Follow Chicago Manual of Style for all abbreviations and VoiceOver reads them correctly. [Numbers - Topic Q&A List - Chicago Manual of Style Online](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Numbers.html?page=1)
